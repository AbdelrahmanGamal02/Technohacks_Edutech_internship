some projects with C programing for Technohacks Edutech internship

The First Project : Number Guessing Game 
 
The project is about how to make user to guess a number based on some hints given by computer to get the number.
first i make the computer to generate random value to make it unexpected for user or every one can read the code to make the project more reliable and the computer more interactive with user then user start to enter the number and try to get the number based on hints given by computer.

The Second Project :  Palindrome Checker 
 
The project is about how to make Computer checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
palindrome mean that when we convert the original string , the converted string is the same with the original string like word (level) if you converted it , it would be the same word.
first computer take the string from the user and start to convert the string and save the converted sting into another array and start compare between two strings if there are the same , so the string is a palindrome , if not , the string is not a palindrome.

The Third Project : Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 
 
The project is about how to make computer plays Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with the user.
first i make the computer to generate random value that I use it to make computer chooses different play every time and make it unexpected for user or every one can read the code to make the project more reliable and the computer more interactive with user then based on the rules of the game , code will define the winner .
